# scrapy_visions
simple scraper on visions.ca products

output.json contains all the products

i remove duplicate product ids in the pipeline

there was no availability or quantity remaining on visions.ca so i skipped it

i crawl some main category patches but ignore them, the products appear in the sub-categories anyways

i include a .csv file too, there is an added column with only distinct columns, it's not related to the other columns
